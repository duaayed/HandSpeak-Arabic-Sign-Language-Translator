<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>
Sign language consists of gestures and expressions used mainly by the hearing-impaired to talk. This project is an effort to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and the hearing-impaired community using Artificial Intelligence.
<h3 align="left">Motivation</h3>
Due to the small number of people who can read sign language, deaf people frequently experience severe communication difficulties. This leads to difficulties in accessing essential services, social exclusion, and a lack of equal opportunities. An AI-powered model that translates sign language into natural language can bridge this communication gap, fostering better interaction and inclusivity. Such a model would empower deaf people by enabling smooth communication, allowing them to access necessary resources and engage more fully in society.

<h2 align="left">Dataset</h2>
After extensive research and evaluation of various datasets, we concluded that KArSL is the most comprehensive and reliable dataset available for Arabic Sign Language (ArSL). KArSL is the largest video dataset
specifically designed for word-level ArSL recognition, widely used across Arab countries. It contains 502 isolated sign words, each performed by three professional signers and repeated 50 times per signer.

We utilized the KARSL Dataset. The dataset comprises 502 distinct sign classes, each performed by two signers. These classes were carefully curated to represent a wide range of Arabic sign language
gestures. The dataset provided a robust foundation for training and evaluating our artificial intelligence model, enabling us to bridge the communication gap between Arabic spoken language and Arabic sign language.

We processed the input frames from the **KARSL Dataset** to generate three specific arrays: **pose-adjusted**, **lh-adjusted**, and **rh-adjusted**. These arrays represent the adjusted keypoints for the
pose, the left hand, and the right hand, respectively. The adjustments ensured that the keypoints were normalized and aligned correctly, enabling consistent and accurate input for the model. This preprocessing step was
critical for improving the robustness and precision of our system's predictions.

<h2 align="left">Usability and User Experience Goals</h2>
The usability and user experience goals of this project were carefully designed to prioritize seamless interaction and accessibility. The primary focus was to deliver a system capable of recognizing gestures in real
time, ensuring users experience smooth and uninterrupted communication. Robust algorithms were implemented to handle diverse conditions, including variations in gestures, lighting, and camera quality, while maintaining
high accuracy. Additionally, the solution was optimized for efficiency, enabling quick response times without compromising on accuracy. By emphasizing integration with widely used communication tools, the project aimed
to make the system adaptable and valuable in various real-world scenarios, ensuring it meets the needs of a diverse user base.

  i. **Educational Value**: Incorporate features that allow non-signers to learn basic sign language gestures, fostering inclusivity and understanding. <br>
  ii. **Transparency**: Provide clear feedback to users about recognized gestures, enhancing confidence in the system’s accuracy.

</details>

<h2 align="left">Preparing the Dataset</h2>
Preparing the dataset was a critical step in building our Arabic Sign Language recognition model. We worked extensively with the KArSL Dataset, which contains a comprehensive collection of 502 isolated sign classes
performed by professional signers. This section details the key steps involved in processing the dataset to ensure it was ready for model training and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary><h3 align="left">Data Extraction</h3></summary>
  Each video was analyzed frame by frame to extract keypoints using MediaPipe. 
  <br>
  i. **Pose Keypoints**: Representing the full-body structure. <br>
  ii. **Left Hand Keypoints**: Capturing detailed movements of the left hand. <br>
  iii. **Right Hand Keypoints**: Capturing detailed movements of the right hand.

</details>

<h3 align="left">Normalization</h3>
All keypoints were normalized to remove variations caused by different scales and orientations of the input videos. This ensured that the model learned features intrinsic to the gestures rather than irrelevant variations.

<details>
  <summary><h3 align="left">Generating Arrays</h3></summary>
  Three arrays were created from the processed data<br> <br>
  
  i. **pose-adjusted**: Adjusted keypoints for the pose in each frame. <br>
  ii. **lh-adjusted**: Adjusted keypoints for the left hand in each frame. <br>
  iii. **rh-adjusted**: Adjusted keypoints for the right hand in each frame.

</details>

<h3 align="left">Challenges Faced</h3>
• Variations in Gestures: Similar starting or ending gestures across different classes required careful preprocessing to ensure clear differentiation.

• Lighting and Background Differences: Frames were preprocessed to mitigate the impact of varying environmental conditions on keypoint detection.


<h3 align="left">Outcome</h3>
The prepared dataset was optimized for input into the Bidirectional LSTM model. By focusing on normalized and adjusted keypoints, we ensured that the model could learn robustly from the sequential data, leading to high
accuracy in gesture recognition. This step played a pivotal role in the success of the project.


<h2 align="left">LSTM Model</h2>

<h3 align="left">Model architecture</h3>
To develop our Arabic sign language model, we utilized a BiLSTM architecture, which is an extension of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), is specifically designed
to model and analyze sequential data. It excels in handling long sequences by selectively retaining or discarding information at each time step, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and make accurate
predictions.

In our study, we observed that many signs in the dataset shared similar starting or ending gestures. This overlap in sequential patterns made the bidirectional nature of BiLSTM particularly valuable. By processing the
data in both forward and backward directions, BiLSTM allowed the model to better capture contextual dependencies from both ends of the sequence, leading to more precise and reliable gesture recognition. This made BiLSTM
the ideal choice for addressing the challenges posed by the intricate structure of our dataset.


<h3 align="left">Python</h3>

```python
# Define the Bidirectional LSTM model with Attention

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)),
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(words), activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['categorical_accuracy'])

# Set up early stopping
early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',  # Metric to monitor for early stopping
    mode='min',  # Set mode to 'min' for minimizing the metric
    patience=5,  # Number of epochs with no improvement before stopping
    restore_best_weights=True,  # Restore the best model weights
    verbose=1
)

model_training_history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train, 
    batch_size=32, 
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val), 
    validation_batch_size=32, 
    epochs=50, 
    callbacks=[early_stopping]
)

<h3 align="left">Model Optimization techniques</h3>
• Early Stopping Technique <br>
The early stopping technique is used to reduce overfitting without compromising on the
model’s accuracy. It consists of stopping training the model when the validation loss begins to
increase while the training loss continues to decrease.

<div align="center">

</div>

• Adam Optimization Algorithm <br>
Adam is an optimization algorithm that can be used instead of the classical stochastic gradient descent procedure to update network weights iterative based in training data.[14]
It offers adaptive learning rates, which dynamically adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on past gradients. This adaptivity provides faster convergence and improves performance across various data and model
architectures.
